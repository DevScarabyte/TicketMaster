What is Trinity GM Helper?:
Trinity GM Helper is an addon for World of Warcraft Private Server Staff
Members. The functionality of this addon is to make ease for new staff.
Trinity GM Helper was originally called ArcEmu GM Helper for the ArcEmu
emulator. The addon was converted to the TrinityCore emulator. Due to
the differences in the two emulators, it was quite a task to convert this
from ArcEmu to Trinity; we have Chillu to thank for that. The addon is now
maintained by Kibblebit of ac-web.org and eternal-wow.com.
